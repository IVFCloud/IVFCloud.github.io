Once we have reached an agreement, you will be invoiced the monthly fee based on the number of users on the platform, and as you add users, your fee will increase concurrent with the per user fee in your agreement. On the inverse side, if your user count decreases, your invoice will decrease concurrent with the number of users that have gone away. Your minimum fee will be the floor price established in your agreement. We believe this makes it so much easier for you to budget your IT costs as part of your overall employee expense, making it easier for you to account for and allocate those expenses.">So how much do I have to pay to get on your platform?</a></li>

This allows our clients to access their legacy EMR data as needed without the need for an expensive data migration project.

In our environment, you as the practice owner/manager decide who has access to patient and business data. We work with you to ensure you are granting access to legitimate users either under your direct control (e.g. employees, practitioners, etc.) and through your business relationships (as established under HIPAA covered by appropriately executed Business Associate Agreements). Our staff is fully trained on HIPAA/HITECH compliance, and we do not access any patient information or files. Our responsibility is the platform and its proper function. Should any troubleshooting be required on your EMR, biller or other component that contains PHI or proprietary information, we will work with you to provide access to the appropriate resources to get to the components in question, for the period of time required for them to complete their work, then ensure that access is turned off so as not to create the opportunity for a data breach. We strongly agree with the HIPAA rules that the patient owns their data, and the practice is the fiduciary custodian of that data. We also strongly believe that your business data is your intellectual property, and do our utmost to ensure it is protected, providing our guidance and counsel on best practices for you, your employees and business associates.">Who has access to my data?</a></li>
